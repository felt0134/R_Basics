```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(learnr)
library(gradethis)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
gradethis::gradethis_setup()
options(tutorial.event_recorder = tutorialize::recorder)
options(tutorial.storage = learnr::filesystem_storage(file.path(path.expand("~"), "_learnr_storage_")))
```

### Directions

This test will be X points and will be taken within this R tutorial. The test will be a mix of multiple choice, free response, and writing R code in response to prompts, much like you have been doing the past two weeks. You will submit the exam on D2L. You will be graded on correctness for every answer and partial credit will be given when warranted.
