## Directions

This test will be 70 points and will be taken within this R tutorial. The test will be a mix of multiple choice, free response, and writing R code in response to prompts, much like you have been doing the past two weeks. You will submit the exam on D2L. You will be graded on correctness for every answer and partial credit will be given when warranted.

## Free Response (4 points total)

```{r interpretation_quiz,exercise.startover = FALSE}
quiz(
  question_text(
    "Q0: What operator is your first line of defense if you are unsure about what a function is or does or how it works in R? (1 point)",
    answer_fn(tutorialize::submitToTA),
    rows = 3,
    correct = "Your answer has been submitted"),
  question_text(
    "Q1: What are the three characteristics of tidy data? (3 points)",
    answer_fn(tutorialize::submitToTA),
    rows = 3,
    correct = "Your answer has been submitted"))  
```

## Multiple Choice (1 point each, 13 points total)

*When you submit a response, there will be a red box logging the submission and a blue box confirming it has been submitted. You can only submit once*

## Coding (53 points total)

Q15: Create a numeric vector from 1 to 1000 that increases by values of 5. Name this vector "vector_1". (5 points)

```{r problem_1, exercise=tutorialize,exercise.reveal_solution=FALSE}
vector_1 <- seq(from = 1,to = 1000,by = 5)
```

Q16: Use recycling to reduce every value in vector_1 by 50%. Name this new vector "vector_1_halved". Then, create an x-y plot with vector_1 on the x axis and vector_1_halved on the y axis. (10 points)

```{r problem_2, exercise=tutorialize,exercise.setup=problem_1,exercise.reveal_solution=FALSE}
vector_1_halved <- vector_1*0.5
plot(vector_1,vector_1_halved)
```


Q17: Create a dataframe that is composed of three columns: 1) a column named 'Production' that is a numeric vector composed of the values 750,500,and 250, 2) a column named 'Precipitation' that is a numeric vector composed of the values 1200, 700, and 200, and 3) a column named 'Biome' that is a character vector composed of the values "Forest","Grassland", and "Desert". Assign this new dataframe the name "NPP". (20 points)

```{r problem_3, exercise=tutorialize,exercise.reveal_solution=FALSE}
NPP <- data.frame(
  Production = c(750,500,250),
  Precipitation = c(1200,700,200),
  Biome = c("Forest","Grassland","Desert")
)
```

Q18: Use an extraction operator to preview the first row of the NPP dataframe you created in Q17 (while retaining all column names). (2 points)

```{r problem_4, exercise=tutorialize,exercise.setup=problem_3,exercise.reveal_solution=FALSE}
NPP[1,]
```

Q19: Use an extraction operator to add a new column to the NPP dataframe called 'RUE' that is calculated as production divided by precipitation. This variable describes how efficiently rainfall is used for plant growth. (5 points)

```{r problem_5, exercise=tutorialize,exercise.setup=problem_3,exercise.reveal_solution=FALSE}
NPP$RUE <- NPP$Production/NPP$Precipitation
```

Q20: Using the NPP dataframe, create an x-y plot that depicts how RUE changes as *a function of* precipitation. You can use *either* of the two approaches (but, within the same function!) to do this that were discussed in class. (5 points)

```{r problem_6, exercise=tutorialize,exercise.setup=problem_5,exercise.reveal_solution=FALSE}
plot(RUE ~ Precipitation,data = NPP)
#plot(NPP$Precipitation,NPP$Production) is also valid
```

Q21: Use the data() function to load in the iris dataframe that comes with R and then use both extraction and comparison operators to filter the iris dataframe to *just* the setosa species. Name this new dataframe iris_setosa. (6 points)
```{r problem_7, exercise=tutorialize,exercise.reveal_solution=FALSE}
data(iris)
iris_setosa <- iris[iris$Species == 'setosa',]
```

## Submitting your Exam

Great job!  You've completed the second Exam!  Now it's time to turn it in...

In the console, enter the following (case sensitive):

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
ENSC311::submit_ENSC311()
```

Your should see something like this:

```{r}
"Week_6_Exam_2_311_<Posit_Cloud_ID>"
```

where the end of the character string is an ID that Posit Cloud assigned you. As you do more tutorials, this list of tutorials you have run will get longer. You must pass the number that corresponds to this assignments. For example, *if* you wanted to turn in the first item on the list, you would enter: ENSC311::submit_ENSC311(1).

A "submit_ENSC311_..." file will appear under the "Files" tab in the lower right pane of RStudio.  Check the box next to the submit file and choose "Export..." from the "More" dropdown on the bar at the top of the tab.  Download the file and submit it to D2L. *Do not change the name of the file*

That's it!  You're all done!
